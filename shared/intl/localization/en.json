      "q3": "I can’t see my PLAT in my wallet! Where is it?",
      "a3": "If you’re using MetaMask, you need enable the BETA UI, and manually add the PLAT token to your token list. Use this address when configuring: 0x7E43581b19ab509BCF9397a2eFd1ab10233f27dE (specify 18 for digits).",

      "a2": "Registered BitGuild users can buy PLAT via the converter on the top right bar of the BitGuild Portal.",
      "q3": "Are there any games that I can play without PLAT?",
      "a3": "Most games will accept only PLAT, though some may accept ETH as well. In this event, using PLAT will always garner a discount for the player. However, some titles may also present users with a free-to-play model, offering players a way to try the game without buying anything.",

      "q2": "I’ve played a 3rd party game outside of BitGuild.com, and now I want to play it through the BitGuild portal. Is that possible?",
      "a2": "Yes. If the game is available on BitGuild.com, but you’ve played it elsewhere before, all your items and progress will be preserved as long as you sign up to BitGuild.com with the same wallet address you used to play the game previously."

      "a8": "Each transaction, either purchasing or gifting, can take from 30 seconds up to a few minutes, depending on the gas price you selected in MetaMask.",
      "q9": "What if my transaction is not going through?",
      "a9": "If a transaction is not going through, MetaMask allows you to increase the gas price for the pending transactions. Transactions get queued, so if one of the previous transactions is stuck, all of the following will be stuck as well.",
      "q10": "How much does each transaction cost (gas price)?",
      "a10": "You can set your gas price through MetaMask. Actual gas spend varies depending on the game and type of transaction."

      "q3": "I forgot my BitGuild name and password. How can I retrieve it?",
